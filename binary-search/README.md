### What is it?

Binary search is an algorithm that we can use to find the value of an element within an array. However, it is only effective if the elements in the array are sorted. If the value you are searching for is in the array, binary search returns the _position_ (or index) of the element. Otherwise, binary search returns `null`.  

  *The binary search algorithm begins by comparing the target value to the value of the middle element of the sorted array.

  *If the target value is equal to the middle element's value, then the position is returned and the search is finished.

+ If the target value is equal to the middle element's value, then the position is returned and the search is finished.
